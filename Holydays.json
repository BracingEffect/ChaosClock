And many women of rank also purposely get in their way, and like children at school present their hands to be struck, believing that the pregnant will thus be helped in delivery, and the barren to pregnancy.\n   </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The Lupercalia festival was partly in honor of Lupa, the she-wolf who suckled the infant orphans, Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, explaining the name of the festival, Lupercalia, or &ldquo;Wolf Festival.&rdquo;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   By the 5th century, when the public performance of pagan rites had been outlawed, a nominally Christian Roman populace still clung to the Lupercalia in the time of Gelasius (494&ndash;96). It had been literally degraded since the 1st century, when in 44 BC the consul Mark Antony did not scruple to run with the Luperci; now the upper classes left the festivities to the rabble. Whatever the fortunes of the rites in the meantime, in the last decade of the 5th century they prompted Pope Gelasius I&rsquo;s taunt to the senators who were intent on preserving them: &ldquo;If you assert that this rite has salutary force, celebrate it yourselves in the ancestral fashion; run nude yourselves that you may properly carry out the mockery.&rdquo; The remark was addressed to the senator Andromachus by Gelasius in an extended literary epistle that was virtually a diatribe against the Lupercalia. Gelasius finally abolished the Lupercalia after a long dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   &mdash;\n   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupercalia\">\n    Lupercalia &mdash; Wikipedia\n   </a>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Then Pope Gelasius I declared it Saint Valentine&rsquo;s Day.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Numerous early Christian martyrs were named Valentine. The Valentines honored on February 14 are Valentine of Rome and Valentine of Terni. Valentine of Rome was a priest in Rome who was martyred about AD 269 and was buried on the Via Flaminia.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Valentine of Terni became bishop of Interamna (modern Terni) about AD 197 and is said to have been martyred during the persecution under Emperor Aurelian. He is also buried on the Via Flaminia, but in a different location than Valentine of Rome.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The Catholic Encyclopedia also speaks of a third saint named Valentine who was mentioned in early martyrologies under date of February 14. He was martyred in Africa with a number of companions, but nothing more is known about him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In the 1969 revision of the Roman Catholic Calendar of Saints, the feast day of Saint Valentine on February 14 was removed from the General Roman Calendar and relegated to particular (local or even national) calendars for the following reason: &ldquo;Though the memorial of Saint Valentine is ancient, it is left to particular calendars, since, apart from his name, nothing is known of Saint Valentine except that he was buried on the Via Flaminia on February 14.&rdquo;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   &mdash;\n   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day\">\n    Valentine&rsquo;s Day &mdash; Wikipedia\n   </a>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  An ancient holyday invented by rain.\n  <br/>\n  A holyday originally celebrating the need, the need for clean.\n  <br/>\n  A holyday since dedicated to fertility, nudity, and man-suckling wolves.\n  <br/>\n  A holyday not born of fever, rather fever was born of it.\n  <br/>\n  A holyday so awesome, a god was created from it.\n  <br/>\n  A holyday so fabulous, it survived being outlawed.\n  <br/>\n  A holyday so stimulating, it made the Pope dare senators to go naked.\n  <br/>\n  A holyday named after\n  <em>\n   three\n  </em>\n  saints, of which nothing is known.\n  <br/>\n  Truly, this is the Best.

It is alleged that cartoonist\n <a href=\"http://www.tvwiki.tv/wiki/Matt_Groening\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  Matt Groening\n </a>\n was aware of it even earlier, and that the stories for the cartoon series\n <a href=\"http://www.tvwiki.tv/wiki/The_Simpsons\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  The Simpsons\n </a>\n includes clues to this.

It is described as existing outside of normal reality, in a sort of hyperspace. Because it connects to many different locales world wide, it supposedly can be used to rapidly travel between far-flung locations. However, the hyperspacial nature of the city is said to cloud the minds of ordinary individuals, with the result that they can only see the 'local' Springfield they believe themselves to be in; only mystical adepts of the 'theochaotic' sects where this theory is prevalent can navigate through the city successfully. According to some claims, certain landmarks - including a vast, looming, nuclear power plant, and a cross-dimensional highway named 'Metaworld 95' - can be readily identified regardless of where one enters the city. Supposedly, M-95 connects Springfield to two other interdimensional cities, known as\n <a href=\"http://www.tvwiki.tv/wiki/Tanelorn\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  Tanelorn\n </a>\n and\n <a href=\"http://www.tvwiki.tv/w/index.php?title=Cynosure&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n  Cynosure\n </a>\n ; it is said to be impossible to travel between the two other cities without passing through Springfield at least once.\n</p>\n<p>\n Needless to say, it is generally assumed that this is nothing more than an elaborate surrealist joke, but when asked about it, most Discordians assert that it must be the literal truth\n <i>\n  because\n </i>\n it is an elaborate surrealist joke.\n</p>\n<p>\n <i>\n  Text blatantly ripped off of\n  <a href=\"http://www.tvwiki.tv/wiki/Springfield_Effect\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n   TVWiki\n  </a>\n </i>\n</p>\n",

Unlike many holidays, it doesn&rsquo;t involve obligations or expense or overblown expectations of specialness. It does not require us to interact with people whom we do not wish to interact with. In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t require us to do anything. Discardia is celebrated by letting go of what doesn&rsquo;t add value to your life&mdash;whether physical object, habit, or emotional baggage&mdash;and replacing it with what makes your world truer to your essential self. The core concept is this: If we continually discard what doesn&rsquo;t help us, we&rsquo;ll be left with more of what does&mdash;more space, energy, and time to make our lives even better.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   &mdash;\n   <a href=\"http://www.discardia.com/2011/09/introduction-to-discardia.html\">\n    Introduction to Discardia\n   </a>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The original Discardia had a rather complicated system to determine its date, occurred four times a year, and each lasted for over a week.

Since we have neither Thursdays nor Aprils, this will remain at 41 Discord.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Take Our Daughters to Work Day was introduced in 1993 by Gloria Steinem and the Ms. Foundation for Women. It was to promote the idea that girls can be and do whatever they want. They were explicitly welcomed into the workplace and told that when they grow up, they can do this too. They can have this job, earn this money, enjoy this success.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Boys already know that. From their baby clothes on, they&rsquo;re told they are on the path to being a baseball player or an astronaut or whatever the hell they want. They&rsquo;re boys. No little brat on the playground is ever going to tell them they can&rsquo;t be a doctor or a fire fighter or a soldier because of their sex. Especially if they&rsquo;re white and middle class and American-born.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When only daughters are taken to to work, the message that they are explicitly valued and welcome in the workplace is clear. When children are taken to work, that message is lost to just another generic &ldquo;Reach for the stars, kids!&rdquo; message that clearly does young girls no favors, and reinforces the entitlement of young boys.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I do see the value in taking all children to work. And I think one change that should be made is de-emphasizing children following their parents to work, because some parents don&rsquo;t work or have jobs that can&rsquo;t accomodate the program. My mother was out of work in 1993, but she was awesome so she arranged for me to spend the day with a reporter from the Philadelphia Inquirer. At the time, all I wanted to be when I grew up was a fast-talking nosy reporter along the lines of Hildy from His Girl Friday. Seeing the inside of a news room was a magical experience for me. I think giving that to all children to reinforce their ambitions and dreams is a lovely goal.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   But: not at the expense of Take Our Daughters to Work Day. Because in other years, when I followed my mom to work at her job that was not even remotely in my dreams, I still got something out of the program that just doesn&rsquo;t happen when the boys come too. I got to see other young girls on the train with their parents, excited for a special day in the big city. I got to hear adults take the time to tell girls what they can do with their lives, praise them for their talents and interests instead of how pretty they look that day.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   My wish is to see Take Our Daughters to Work Day brought back in its true form. But as an adjunct, to share the joy and to shut up the &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t somebody think of the BOYS!&rdquo; critics, let&rsquo;s have When I Grow Up Day. Where we take all children (not just the daughters and sons of workers) to a job they&rsquo;re interested in.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Because yes, all kids deserve to be shown the working world. But Take Our Daughters to Work Day is about more than that. It tells girls &ldquo;we value you, we welcome you, we&rsquo;re waiting for you.&rdquo; When it&rsquo;s just a day for all kids, the day becomes just another message of, &ldquo;You can come too, even though you are a girl.&rdquo;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   &mdash;\n   <a href=\"http://atdoublerdiner.com/2011/04/28/take-back-take-our-daughters-to-work-day/\">\n    Take Back Take Our Daughters to Work Day\n   </a>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Not to be confused with Take Our Children to Work Day, which is the &ldquo;What about the menz?&rdquo; version.\n </p>",

Red light has the longest wavelength; violet the shortest. The colours in between have wavelengths between those of red and violet light.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     When our eyes see colours, they are actually detecting the different wavelengths of the light hitting the retina. Colours are distinguished by their wavelengths, and the brain processes this information and produces a visual display that we experience as colour.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     This means that colours only really exist within the brain &mdash; light is indeed travelling from objects to our eyes, and each object may well be transmitting/reflecting a different set of wavelengths of light; but what essentially defines a &ldquo;colour&rdquo; as opposed to a &ldquo;wavelength&rdquo; is created within the brain.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     If the eye receives light of more than one wavelength, the colour generated in the brain is formed from the sum of the input responses on the retina. For example, if red light and green light enter the eye at the same time, the resulting colour produced in the brain is yellow, the colour halfway between red and green in the spectrum.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     So what does the brain do when our eyes detect wavelengths from both ends of the light spectrum at once (i.e. red and violet light)? Generally speaking, it has two options for interpreting the input data:\n    </p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n     <li>\n      Sum the input responses to produce a colour halfway between red and violet in the spectrum (which would in this case produce green &mdash; not a very representative colour of a red and violet mix)\n     </li>\n     <li>\n      Invent a new colour halfway between red and violet\n     </li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>\n     Magenta is the evidence that the brain takes option &ldquo;b&rdquo; &mdash; it has apparently constructed a colour to bridge the gap between red and violet, because such a colour does not exist in the light spectrum. Magenta has no wavelength attributed to it, unlike all the other spectrum colours.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     &mdash;\n     <a href=\"http://www.biotele.com/magenta.html\">\n      Magenta Ain&rsquo;t A Colour\n     </a>\n    </p>\n   </blockquote>\n  \n  <dt>\n   <a>\n    30 Cfn &mdash; Zoog Day\n   </a>\n  </dt>\n  \n   <blockquote>\n    <p>\n     This one may seem out of place, as it was originally intended to create a balance in the world of commercially endorsed holidays. However, its following is small enough that it still qualifies as an alternative holiday.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Many years ago, it was determined that there are several holidays distributed throughout the year that revolve around candy and greetings cards, but that all of the popular gift-giving holidays were concentrated in Winter. To create a balance, Zoog Day takes place 6 months away from the popular Christmas holiday. Decorations are slanted towards purple and orange, and celebrants are encouraged to procure and decorate a Zoog Tree. Zoog trees are spiny, purple, and perfectly cylindrical. Zoog the All-Nifty is said to fly around that night on the back of his magical griffin, teleporting presents into people&rsquo;s kitchens.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Though it is only a coincidence that Zoog&rsquo;s name is shared by a race of beings from the Dreamlands, Lovecraft enthusiasts are nevertheless encouraged to celebrate this day by releasing swarms of zoogs into the waking world, and watching with delight as people discover that these cute, fuzzy creatures are carnivorous, and perfectly willing to eat people.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     &mdash;\n     <a href=\"http://alum.wpi.edu/~wes/holiday.htm\">\n      Celebrate Something Bizarre\n     </a>\n    </p>\n   </blockquote>\n  \n  <dt>\n   <a>\n    37 Cfn &mdash; Midyear\n   </a>\n  </dt>\n  \n   <p>\n    An often-depressing calendrical event rarely celebrated.\n   </p>\n  \n  <dt>\n   <a>\n    38 Cfn &mdash; Civil Disobedience Day\n   </a>\n  </dt>\n  \n   <p>\n    Unjust laws must be broken.\n   </p>\n  \n  <dt>\n   <a>\n    39 Cfn &mdash; Higgs Boson Day\n   </a>\n  </dt>\n  \n   <p>\n    On this day in 2012, CERN announced the discovery of the Higgs Boson, the elusive little fella who is responsible for giving everything around us mass.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To celebrate, attend large parties where you consume a lot of food in an attempt to gain mass.\n   </p>\n  \n  <dt>\n   <a>\n    45 Cfn &mdash; Silence Day\n   </a>\n  </dt>\n  \n   <p>\n    In honor of Meher Baba, we believe in reminding religious people to be quiet.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote>\n    <p>\n     Man&rsquo;s inability to live God&rsquo;s words makes the Avatar&rsquo;s teaching a mockery.

However, its following is small enough that it still qualifies as an alternative holiday.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Many years ago, it was determined that there are several holidays distributed throughout the year that revolve around candy and greetings cards, but that all of the popular gift-giving holidays were concentrated in Winter. To create a balance, Zoog Day takes place 6 months away from the popular Christmas holiday. Decorations are slanted towards purple and orange, and celebrants are encouraged to procure and decorate a Zoog Tree. Zoog trees are spiny, purple, and perfectly cylindrical. Zoog the All-Nifty is said to fly around that night on the back of his magical griffin, teleporting presents into people&rsquo;s kitchens.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Though it is only a coincidence that Zoog&rsquo;s name is shared by a race of beings from the Dreamlands, Lovecraft enthusiasts are nevertheless encouraged to celebrate this day by releasing swarms of zoogs into the waking world, and watching with delight as people discover that these cute, fuzzy creatures are carnivorous, and perfectly willing to eat people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  &mdash;\n  <a href=\"http://alum.wpi.edu/~wes/holiday.htm\">\n   Celebrate Something Bizarre\n  </a>\n </p>\n</blockquote>",
